          <b>Srinivasa Ramanujan</b>, (born December 22, 1887, Erode, India—died
          April 26, 1920, Kumbakonam), Indian mathematician whose contributions
          to the theory of numbers include pioneering discoveries of the
          properties of the partition function.

          When he was 15 years old, he obtained a copy of George Shoobridge
          Carr’s Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics,
          2 vol. (1880–86). This collection of thousands of theorems, many
          presented with only the briefest of proofs and with no material newer
          than 1860, aroused his genius. Having verified the results in Carr’s
          book, Ramanujan went beyond it, developing his own theorems and ideas.
          In 1903 he secured a scholarship to the University of Madras but lost
          it the following year because he neglected all other studies in
          pursuit of mathematics.

          Ramanujan continued his work, without employment and living in the
          poorest circumstances. After marrying in 1909 he began a search for
          permanent employment that culminated in an interview with a government
          official, Ramachandra Rao. Impressed by Ramanujan’s mathematical
          prowess, Rao supported his research for a time, but Ramanujan,
          unwilling to exist on charity, obtained a clerical post with the
          Madras Port Trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1911 Ramanujan published the first of his papers in the Journal of
          the Indian Mathematical Society. His genius slowly gained recognition,
          and in 1913 he began a correspondence with the British mathematician
          Godfrey H. Hardy that led to a special scholarship from the University
          of Madras and a grant from Trinity College, Cambridge. Overcoming his
          religious objections, Ramanujan traveled to England in 1914, where
          Hardy tutored him and collaborated with him in some research.
        </p>
        <p>
          In England Ramanujan made further advances, especially in the
          partition of numbers (the number of ways that a positive integer can
          be expressed as the sum of positive integers; e.g., 4 can be expressed
          as 4, 3 + 1, 2 + 2, 2 + 1 + 1, and 1 + 1 + 1 + 1). His papers were
          published in English and European journals, and in 1918 he was elected
          to the Royal Society of London. In 1917 Ramanujan had contracted
          tuberculosis, but his condition improved sufficiently for him to
          return to India in 1919. He died the following year, generally unknown
          to the world at large but recognized by mathematicians as a phenomenal
          genius, without peer since Leonhard Euler (1707–83) and Carl Jacobi
          (1804–51). Ramanujan left behind three notebooks and a sheaf of pages
          (also called the “lost notebook”) containing many unpublished results
          that mathematicians continued to verify long after his death.
